## Notice ⛔
Please make sure in the `.css` files you are making/using , the styles should be applied to **Unique Class names** 

If there are **images** in your `.jsx` files  give them unique classnames like **registrationImage , clubLoginImage**, then in the `css` files make sure the styles are applied to those unique classnames. Else things are getting messed up.
